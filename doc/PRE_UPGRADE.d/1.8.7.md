**CAREFUL, THIS UPGRADE WILL WIPE DATA.**

This is a Duniter issue, not related to YunoHost, see <https://forum.duniter.org/t/duniter-v1-8-7-release/11222/61>.

You will just have to restart the synchronization.

If you think you lost data in the process, don't forget that YunoHost provides backups!
